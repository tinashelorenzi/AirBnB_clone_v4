# AirBnB_clone

The goal of the AirBnB_clone project is to deploy a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/)
Only some of the  features will be implemented at intervals to cover the
fundamental concepts of higher level programming.

Some of the features that will be implemented are:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
